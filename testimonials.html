        <h2>Testimonials </h2>
            
            <p class=test>Due to the nature of the procedure, our success is marked by our client's lack of knowledge of the memory erasure. In lieu of their recommendations, we can provide testimonials from the loved ones of clients who have seen first-hand the positive impacts the procedure has had. Please contact us if you would like to contact a reference directly. </p>
            <blockquote>"When my sister's last relationship ended, she wouldn't get out of bed for months. She lost her sanity, her job, and all of her friends. I told her about Lacuna after I saw an ad on TV, and went with her through the whole process. By the end, she was just as bright-eyed and excited about life as she was before she met him. She got her job and her friends back, and has no memory of the horrible relaitonship. I would recommend Lacuna to anyone who may need it." - Mary Billings

            <blockquote>
            "My wife had been effected by PTSD from childhood trauma for her whole life. She was always horribly anxious and jumpy, and had a hard time trusting anyone or even leaving the house sometime. We both agreed that the procedure would be a good idea. Dr. Mierzwiak and his team were extremely personable and detail-oriented. Now, she is like a whole new person but somehow still herself. She had no recollection of the trauma or the procedure. I'm so glad we went through with it." - John Leaner

            <blockquote>
            "My youngest daughter had an imaginary friend named Nellie growing up. When she reached the age of 10, her social development was stunted because she still believed in Nellie and refused to make any real friends. Her father and I decided it would be best to dissolve her memory of Nellie and it was the best decision we've made for her. She's now doing well in school and hasn't reverted back to her fantastical ways. Thank you Lacuna!" - Penelope Dean
